            <h1>Brandon Scholten</h1>
            <p>
                I am a computer science student who applies technology in ways which make the world a better place. As a high school senior I graduated with my associates degree in cyber security. As I pursue my next degree I want to put the skills I have learned in my classes at Kent State and Marion Technical College to use in the real world. I currently work in a computer repair center on campus where I help support students and faculty. I do my best to leave customers helpful answers, even when I may not be able to solve a problem. My mission to implement technology in constructive ways goes beyond my work and bleeds into every aspect of my life. I believe that we can make the world a better place by using technology ethically and effectively in our communities. I want to help build solutions which improve the lives of those around me and around the world.
